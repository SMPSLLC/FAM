# FAM
Flask - AngularJS - MySQL (Basic Student Crud App)

This is a Flask-based web application that allows you to manage a list of students.
You can add new students, view existing ones, update their information, and delete them if needed.
This project was created as part of a course assignment, but I hope you find it useful and informative.

## Usage

To use this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies in your terminal.
2. Create a new MySQL database and update the database connection details in `app.py`.
3. Run the Flask application by running `python app.py` or `flask run` in your terminal.
4. Open the `frontend` folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to install the required frontend dependencies.
5. Run `ng serve` to start the Angular development server.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to access the Angular frontend.

## Inspiration vs. Copying

I want to remind you that copying and pasting code without understanding it isn't the best approach.
Instead, take the time to really dive into the code and figure out how it works.
Use my project as a learning resource and a source of inspiration, but try to make it your own by putting your own spin on things. 

Good luck!
